# computational-tools
Tools for scientific computing and optimization, including gradient descent and Newton optimizers, as well as scientific animation and visualization tools.

## 1d and 2d optimizers

These scripts perform numerical gradient descent and Newton optimization on arbitrary functions, and plot the result. These can be easily integrated into any software that requires numerical optimization.

## double-pendulum-animation.py

A Langrangian-based double pendulum animation which solves the equation of motion numerically, and plots the path.
